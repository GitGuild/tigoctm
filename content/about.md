Tigo CTM is the one stop shop for Cryptocurrency Tellar Machines. Starting the highest quality [hardware](/products), Free and Open [software](http://deginner.com/ctm/), and an extended [partner network](/partners), we make owning a CTM business as easy as plug and play.

Founded in 2015 by a former [Coinapult](https://coinapult.com) developer, Tigo started with a single CTM in our home town Panama City, Panama.

Installing and operating a [Lamassu](http://lamassu.is) machine was a pain free and profitable business. Of course, not everyone is a software engineer, or has personal relationships with the various providers of wallet, exchange, and other services.

In fact, we even hear about people who mothballed their CTMs due to unfamiliarity and working with unreliable service providers. What a waste of capital! These are literally cash generating machines, and their operations are 90% automated. So we decided to lend a hand to less technical operators by walking them through that last 10%.
