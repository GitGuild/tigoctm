<p></p>
Tigo CTM uses [Lamassu](http://lamassu.is) machines because they are the most popular in the industry, and they have a free and open software stack.
  
For each level, Tigo operators also get [Dash](http://dash.org), [cosigning](http://deginner.com/ctm), and other value add features pre-installed.

## Douro

Lamassu's basic model, the Douro, lets users buy Bitcoin with cash. This one-directional operation is the simplest place to start, and may have legal advantages in some jurisdictions.

#### Braga

This floor stand is designed to match the Douro, and cuts down installation work by 90%. Tigo can help with custom installations, for those who desire.

## Santa Tirso

Lamassu's two-way upgrade Santa Tirso, lets users buy __and sell__ Bitcoin with cash. It also doubles as a stand, replacing the Braga.
