    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency are growing an a phenomenal rate. In fact, experts expect the industry will see over 1 billion dollars in investment during 2016. Amazon, Paypal, Ferrari, and many other international firms now accept Bitcoin. What seemed the domain of tech geeks and fringe freedom seekers, its now moving into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Unfortunately purchasing Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Dash privately and conveniently is difficult, and often impossible. Moving crypto back into fiat cash is worse.</p>
<p>It requires complex, expensive, and highly scrutinized wire transfers, tons of paperwork, and more.</p>
<p>Even when possible through bank and wire transfers, using banks eliminates privacy, destroying one of the main reasons cryptocurrency popularity is growing.</p>
<p>**Cryptocurrency Teller Machines (CTMs)** help customers overcome these problems. But until TIGO entered the market, CTM owners have struggled due to technical issues, lack of connections in the field, and misunderstandings of the Cryptocurrency world.</p>
